gRainbow is a pitch-detecting granular synthesizer in a rainbow theme. Users import an audio clip (the longer the better), and gRainbow analyzes the pitches found throughout the track to determine positions where harmonic grains can be generated for each note on the chromatic scale. Users are able to configure multiple grain generators for each chromatic note, and MIDI messages trigger grains to be generated from the respective note's generators. gRainbow is octave independent (meaning all C's, C#'s, etc. will sound the same), but true fundamental frequency pitch detection is on the development roadmap. 

Pick up the built binaries for your platform and a preset to try out [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15cWuho80ZHH8UjWXOJh8qlVX3ZgvJNlc?usp=sharing). The code repository is currently kept private in hopes of commercializing someday, but feel free to [email me](mailto:bradyboettcher@gmail.com) if you want to help out with the project!
