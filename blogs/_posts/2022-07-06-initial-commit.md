I've set up this blog portion of the website so that I can easily make posts about various things I'm thinking about from time to time. I'm hoping to find a balance here between streams-of-consciousness and formal publications so I can produce advanced yet digestible posts about topics I'm interested in. Knowing myself, these topics might include music, technology, signals and mappings, books I'm reading, consciousness (the technical parts) and more.
