The Harmonigon is an interactive synthesis program that lets users explore the wonderful isomorphic interface that is the [harmonic table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_table_note_layout). In addition to simple clicking to trigger notes on the interface, users can switch to chord mode and click intersections to play multiple adjacent notes at once (which results in either a major or minor triad depending on the intersection). Paths can be created through notes or intersections (depending on the active mode) to loop notes or chords at configurable intervals and lengths. All synthesis is done with simple sine waves as the program is intended to be an exploration tool for the harmonic table. Implementing MIDI I/O to convert the program into a MIDI plugin would be an interesting next step, and other contributions are welcome as well!
