Mapper4Live is a software plugin made for the popular digital audio workstation software Ableton Live. Mapper4Live exposes Abletonâ€™s synthesis and effect parameters on the distributed *libmapper* signal mapping network, providing new opportunities for interaction between software and hardware synths, audio effects, and controllers.

This enables libmapper-compatible devices such as [Probatio](http://www-new.idmil.org/project/probatio/) and the [T-Stick](http://www-new.idmil.org/project/the-t-stick/) to control Ableton synthesis and effect parameters with their gestural signals.

You can find the code repository [here](https://github.com/bboettcher3/Mapper4Live).

A paper on Mapper4Live was published in the New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) 2022 conference, and can be found [here](https://nime.pubpub.org/pub/lrhx3rpu/release/1).
