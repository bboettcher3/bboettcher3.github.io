title: Addressing Barriers for Entry and Operation of a Distributed Signal Mapping Framework
---

The novelty and usefulness of the distributed signal mapping framework libmapper has been demonstrated in many
projects and publications, yet its technical entry and operation requirements are often too high to be feasible as a mapping option for less-technical users. This paper focuses on
completing key development tasks to overcome these barriers including improvements to software distribution and
mapping session management. The impact of these changes
was evaluated by asking several artists to design an interactive audiovisual installation using libmapper. Observations
and feedback from the artists throughout their projects let
us assess the impact of the developments on the usability
of the framework, suggesting key development principles for
related tools created in research contexts.
